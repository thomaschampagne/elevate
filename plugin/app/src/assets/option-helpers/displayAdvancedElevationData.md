## Average Elevation
---

The... average elevation of your activity 😄

## Elevation Quartiles
---

For understanding these indicators, we assume that 0% to 100% are all the elevations sorted ascending you obtained during an activity.  

- 25% Quartile: This indicator represents the elevations you maintained at the position "25%". This is commonly called "Lower quartile" or Q1.  
- 50% Median: This indicator represents the elevations you maintained at the position "50%". It's simply the median...  
- 75% Quartile: This indicator represents the elevations you maintained at the position "75%". This is commonly called "Upper quartile" or Q3.

## Average Ascent Speed or VAM
---

VAM is an abbreviation for the Italian term "Velocità Ascensionale Media", translated in English to mean "average ascent speed" or "mean ascent velocity". This is basically your average ascent speed while climbing. The unit used in StravistiX to represent this indicator is "Vm/h" for vertical metres per hour.
