                The multi sports fitness trend is based on an impulse-response model by <u>Dr. Eric W. Banister</u>
                in 1975 and <u>Andrew R. Coggan</u> later. The following reference has been used: <a

                Since strava only provides fitness, fatigue, form for cycling. Here you will be able to view your
                fitness trend using all activities where you held a heart rate monitor. It's an improved feature which
                where missing, not a duplicate! <u>Hoping that strava will make it for all sports!</u><br/><br/>

                Multi sports fitness trend is calculated from your various heart rate stress. A heart rate stress is
                represented by an value called <i>TRaining IMPulse</i> or <i>TRIMP</i>.
                Training Impulse concept has been developed by Dr. Eric W. Banister. Basically, it represents the amount
                of
                heart stress
                during an activity: the longer you go at full
                throttle during an activity, the more <i>TRIMP</i> of activity goes up!

                    <i>TRIMP</i> has both a positive and a negative effect. The positive effect is called <i>fitness</i>,
                    and the negative
                    effect is called <i>fatigue</i>. <i>Fitness</i> and <i>fatigue</i> can combined to provide a value
                    of
                    <i>form</i> or <i>Performance</i>.

                    the feature, then the "Power Stress

                    computation only if available.

                    A "Swimming Stress Score" (Swim SS) can be computed for each of your swim activities if your "Swimming Functional Threshold Pace" (Swim FTP) has been entered inside athlete settings and you enabled swimming stress score option.
                    No heart rate monitor is required. Even a swimming manual activity will be handled by the system. <a href="https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/calculating-swimming-tss-score/" target="_blank">Learn more from TrainingPeaks.</a>

                    <i>Note:</i> Strava do not support HR data for swimming activities at the moment (on march 2017). In the case where you have HRM while swimming and strava finally support HR data then TRIMP value will be used instead of Swim SS.

                    The Fitness, Fatigue and Form graph and table is based off an impulse-response model first developed
                    by Dr. Eric W. Banister in 1975.
                    It was later redefined by <a href="http://www.peakscoachinggroup.com/DrAndrewCoggan"

                    This model will show you:
                    <ul>
                        <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Your <i>Fitness</i> based on your chronic load</li>
                        <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Your <i>Fatigue</i> based on your acute load</li>
                        <li>Your <i>Form</i> or stress balance</li>

                Explanations...
                <ul>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
                        The <i>Fitness</i> curve is the long-term average daily training
                        load.
                        Default period is fixed to 42 days (or six weeks), so it will take ~6 weeks for your
                        <i>Fitness</i>
                        to be accurate. It's basically the foundations, the potential availability of the
                        athlete... You can't get into big rides/runs or races without a minimum of fitness acquired. If
                        that curve is too
                        regular or too flat, it is not usually a sign of good training.
                    </li>

                    <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
                        The <i>Fatigue</i> curve is the short-term average daily training
                        load.
                        Same way than <i>Fitness</i> but
                        default period is fixed to 7 days (one week). Conceptually, fatigue is easy to understand: It's
                        the
                        tired feelings which limits your performance. This curve varies much faster than <i>Fitness</i>
                        curve. On <i>Fatigue</i>
                        curve, you can see the fatigue climbing sharply in response where you performed workouts with a
                        high
                        stress. But also go down quickly as you take few days off.
                    </li>

                    <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
                        The <i>Form</i> curve is simply the difference between <i>Fitness</i> and
                        <i>Fatigue</i>, it's the right balance of stress you should look at to avoid over training for
                        example.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Form = Fitness - Fatigue
                        <br/><br/>
                        When:
                        <br/>
                        <ul>
                            <!--<li>Form < 0: Athlete is on overload or over-training phase.</li>-->
                            <li><i>+25 < Form :</i> Transition zone. Athlete is on form. Case where athlete has an
                                extended break. (e.g. illness, injury or end of the season).
                            </li>
                            <li><i>+5 < Form < +25 :</i> Freshness Zone. Athlete is on form. Ready for a race.</li>
                            <li><i>-10 < Form < +5 :</i> Neutral Zone. Zone reached typically when athlete is in a rest
                                or recovery week. After a race or hard training period.
                            </li>
                            <li><i>-30 < Form < -10 :</i> Optimal Training Zone.</li>
                            <li><i>Form < -30 :</i> Over Load Zone. Athlete is on overload or over-training phase. He
                                should take rest!

                        Be fit doesn't mean you are ready to race at your higher level. A negative <i>Form</i> would
                        reveal that you are carrying fatigue and are not on form. By resting you can
                        remove fatigue faster than you lose fitness and come into form for your race day (or punish
                        friend day... ;))!
