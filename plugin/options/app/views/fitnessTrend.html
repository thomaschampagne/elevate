                <br/><br/>Since strava only provides fitness for cycling. Here you will be able to view your fitness
                trend using all activities where you held a heart rate monitor and/or cycling power meter and/or swimming activities having distance & time. It's an improved feature which where missing,
                not a duplicate! <u>Hoping that strava will make it for all sports!</u>
                <br/><br/>
                <md-icon>warning</md-icon>
                Only activities having heart rate data and/or cycling power meter data and/or swimming activities having distance & time will be used. You will not see others activities at the moment. It's planned by the way (e.g. Run or cycling only with the strava app)
